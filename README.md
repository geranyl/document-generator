#A Pandoc based document generator

##Setup

Install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html), then in your command line from this project's directory run `npm install`. If you haven't heard of npm, you'll need to look into installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 
##To run

From command line `grunt`. It will open in your browser automatically and watch for file changes to keep updating the output html. 

 
##About

When looking into how to build out some team documentation, I became frustrated with typical word processing software. I really like Pandoc's versatility and have used it in the past so this was built. Note that I built this using OSX so you may have issues depending on what bash you use.
